Project: Weather Chat (React + Vite)

Brief explanation of the approach

- Purpose and scope
  - Built a small chat-style weather UI where the user types a location or short question and receives a concise weather response.
  - Focused on a simple, componentized React single-page app to demonstrate UI composition and fetch-based integration with a weather API.

- Architecture and components
  - UI-centric, client-side React application. No backend is included by default.
  - Component breakdown:
    - `ChatWindow` — manages message list, scroll behavior, and overall chat layout.
    - `InputBox` — controlled input component that handles user input, validation, and submit events.
    - `MessageBubble` — presentational component for user and app messages.
    - `TypingIndicator` — small UI piece that shows when the app is waiting for a response.
    - `WeatherIcon` — maps weather conditions to icons for quick visual feedback.
  - `src/utils/fetchWeatherData.js` centralizes the API call and normalization of the weather response.

- Key implementation decisions
  - Use Vite for fast development (HMR) and a minimal build configuration.
  - Keep components small and focused to make them easy to test and reuse.
  - Keep API fetching logic separate from presentation so it can be swapped or proxied later.

- Data flow
  - User types and submits a query via `InputBox` -> `ChatWindow` triggers `fetchWeatherData` -> result returned and normalized -> `ChatWindow` appends response message with `WeatherIcon`.

Areas for improvement (prioritized)

1. Secure API usage and backend proxy
   - Problem: API keys or requests in client-side code expose secrets and run into CORS or rate-limit issues.
   - Improvement: Add a lightweight backend (Node/Express or serverless function) to hold API keys and serve proxied requests. This also enables caching and request throttling.

2. Error handling & retry
   - Problem: Current implementation likely has minimal error handling for network failures, invalid locations, or rate limiting.
   - Improvement: Add clear UX for errors, retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors, and user-friendly messages for validation failures.

3. Environment & configuration
   - Problem: No `.env.example` or structured config for API endpoints and keys.
   - Improvement: Add `.env.example`, document required environment variables in `README.md`, and use Vite env variables (prefix VITE_) for non-secret configuration.

4. Tests
   - Problem: No unit or integration tests present.
   - Improvement: Add unit tests for `fetchWeatherData.js` (mocking fetch) and component tests (React Testing Library) for core UI flows.

5. Accessibility & UX polishing
   - Problem: Chat UI may miss accessibility features like keyboard focus management, ARIA attributes, and screen reader semantics.
   - Improvement: Add proper ARIA roles, keyboard shortcuts, focus traps where needed, and run an accessibility audit.

6. Caching and performance
   - Problem: Repeated requests for the same location cause redundant network calls.
   - Improvement: Add simple in-memory caching on the backend or client-side caching with TTL; consider debounce on input and avoid duplicate queries.

7. Monitoring and logging
   - Problem: No observability for production errors or usage.
   - Improvement: Integrate Sentry (or similar) for error tracking and simple analytics for usage patterns.

8. UI tests and visual regression
   - Problem: Visual regressions can slip into the UI.
   - Improvement: Add Storybook for component development and a visual regression tool (Chromatic, Percy, or Playwright snapshots).

Next steps I can implement for you

- Create a `.env.example` and update `README.md` with env instructions.
- Implement a small proxy server (Node + Express) with a single endpoint to fetch weather data securely (and update `fetchWeatherData.js` to use it).
- Add unit tests for `fetchWeatherData.js` using Jest and msw (or similar) to mock API responses.

Pick one and I'll start it. If you want me to proceed I will mark the next todo `in-progress` and implement it.
